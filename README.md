# PokerApp

Poker simulation application. A set number of virtual poker players each receive two 'hole' cards. 
Five 'community' cards are dealt. Scores are given for the highest hand each player
can make with five cards total, using both their 'hole' and 'community' cards.
Scores are then compared to calculate winner(s) and/or ties.
